Everyone with an interest in electrochemistry in Denmark or internationally can become a member of the Danish Electrochemical Society.
The available types of memberships and their associated annual fees are listed below. Membership fees are due in Danish kroner (DKK), while prices in euros (€) are indicative.

- Personal membership: 150 DKK (€20)

- Student membership (including PhD students): 75 DKK (€10)

- Small company / institute / group membership (up to 10 electrochemists): 1000 DKK (€135)

- Large company / institute membership (more than 10 electrochemists): 2000 DKK (€270)

There are two ways to obtain a personal or student membership:  

1. You can write an email to <secretary@electrochemistry.dk> containing your name, address, email and affiliation. Please indicate if you qualify for student membership (i.e., if you are a PhD/graduate/undergraduate student at a Danish or international institution). You will then receive an invoice of the membership fee to be paid before the membership is effective.  

2. When you register for the annual meeting, you can opt for a fee including one year’s personal or student membership. Please follow the guidelines in the registration form and pay the fee as indicated.  

To sign up your company/institute/group for a membership please write an email to <secretary@electrochemistry.dk> containing the name, address, CVR/SE number (if applicable) and EAN number (if applicable) of the entity and the name and email of the contact person responsible for the membership. Please indicate the approximate number of people who will benefit from the membership (electrochemists and suchlike). You will then receive an invoice of the membership fee to be paid before the membership is effective.  

Invoices for membership renewal will be sent out annually in the autumn right after the annual meeting.
